                >- I want to catch the moon!</span
              >
              â€“ said the frog boldly and dreamily.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              His two friends, the turtle and the crucian, first silently opened
              their eyes wide, looking at each other, and then curiously turned
              their eyes to the sky.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              At that time, the spring sun was shining beautifully in the sky.
              Warm rays have already melted the ice on the lake and started to
              warm the earth. Which meant it was time for the plants to wake up
              and recreate the annual magic of life. All the animals were
              pleased, because the best time was ahead. It was near the steep
              bank that the friends sat and had their conversation.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- No. I don't want to catch him there</span
              >, - the frog realized that his friends were looking in the wrong
              place, -
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >I want to catch him here. In our lake. Yesterday I saw him
                splashing in the water and teasing me with a silver path.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              Crucian laughed loudly, quickly realizing what his friend was
              talking about.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- Well, it is not a moon. It's just his reflection on the
                water</span
              >, - the crucian explained with a bit of disappointment what
              exactly saw the frog.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- Then I want to catch the reflection</span
              >, - stood the green-eyed frog, -
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >It is so beautiful, it sparkled and I want to look at it up
                close.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              The crucian stroked the frog's shoulder with his fin and said.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- This is impossible. Don't waste time. Better let's bask in
                the embrace of the sun. How many months we waited for this
                grace.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              With these words, the crucian flashed its scales and swam to the
              center of the lake to enjoy the spring gift of warm.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              This time the turtle spoke:
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- I am not sure that your idea can be turned into reality. But
                I will gladly help you in your hunt for the silver moon</span
              >, - she smiled and continued, -
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >But I don't understand how to get it at all...</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- Yes, this is another problem. I thought of tying a long rope
                and throwing it to the moon when it had thinned to a thin arc.
                But now... you can't catch the glare like that.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- Maybe it can be scooped up</span
              >, - said the turtle thoughtfully.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica">- Yes!</span> -
              the frog said so loudly that his friend shuddered in surprise, -
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"></span>You're
              right. It is necessary not to catch it from above, but from below.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              The frog stood up and looked at the calm water:
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- Let's make a ladle, only with a long handle. And at night we
                will quietly swim up and scoop up that moon.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              The friends continued to sit by the shore and discuss their plan.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- Frog, what will you do with the moon?</span
              >
              - suddenly asked the turtle.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- I don't know</span
              >, - answered frog honestly, -
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >I just want to look at it in my hands. Look at that silver
                glow. Such curiosity takes...</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- You are strange. But the case is really interesting</span
              >, - smiled the owner of the shell, -
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >Oh, and where are you going to get the ladle?</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              The frog thought for a moment. He turned his head to survey the
              entire space around him, and then said decisively:
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- There is nowhere to take it, it remains only to make it
                yourself</span
              >, - then he carefully looked into the turtle's eyes and
              thoughtfully continued, -
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >With your and crucian's help, we will be able to arrange
                something before nightfall.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              And the animals, like skillful engineers, began to think through
              the design. A long reed could be used for a handle. However, it
              was not so strong, it could not withstand the load. The frog had
              to quickly abandon this idea.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              The frog began to actively walk along the very edge of the lake.
              Water splashed playfully on the legs of the young inventor while
              he seemed to be talking to himself, only occasionally exchanging
              words with his friend. Sometimes he even gesticulated with his
              paws, conducting a fierce discussion, sorting through the options
              for materials, fasteners and drawing clear drawings of his new
              invention in his mind.
            </p>
            <img
              class="section-catchTheGlare__image-second"
              src="./images/birch-catchTheGlare.svg"
              alt="birch-catchTheGlare"
            />
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              Then came the idea of breaking a long birch twig. Fortunately,
              there was a tree felled by beavers nearby, where you could get the
              required element. They decided on that. It remains to invent the
              ladle itself.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              Friends started exchanging ideas and thoughts. However, as quickly
              as they arose, the options disappeared. What can you put water in
              so that it stays there? There was only silence in response to this
              question.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- That is all. I have exhausted my imagination</span
              >, - sighed the turtle.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- I agree. And there is still no solution</span
              >, - then the green-eyed wrinkled his forehead, came closer to his
              friend and sat down next to her, -
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >I have only one option left to tie a weave from willow twigs,
                maybe add cattail feathers to retain water. However, it will not
                be enough for a long time.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              A little upset, the frog continued:
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- It can delay the moon for a few seconds. You know, this will
                be enough for me</span
              >, - he smiled with satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica">- Me too</span>,
              - added the turtle.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              They quickly headed for the crucian, which was swimming almost
              sleepily not far from its companions. They talked about their
              plan, about their invention, about their desire to look at that
              distant glow. And he did not hesitate to agree. Still, the idea
              interested him too.
            </p>
            <img
              class="section-catchTheGlare__image-third"
              src="./images/reedMace-catchTheGlare.svg"
              alt="reedMace-catchTheGlare"
            />
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              The day was already beginning to pass by lunchtime. The other
              animals in the lake went about their business, not noticing the
              three almost dreamers, who began to actively implement their idea
              into life.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              First, they went to a fallen tree, the top of which was completely
              in the water. They sailed around several times until they decided
              on the best option. They grasped the twig tightly and pulled with
              all their might. From the first time, it did not give up. But the
              animals did not give up. For the sake of such a goal, you can
              sweat. They tried as hard as they could, wrestled with the branch
              in all directions until it cracked.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              And now the first element of the structure is already in hand.
              Friends rejoiced, it was as if fate itself was on their side.
              Emotions overflowed, they joked and smiled, already happy with the
              work done. But there was no time to relax. Time went on
              relentlessly, and it was still necessary to finish what had been
              started.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              They quickly scuttled to the nearest willow tree. The animals did
              not even have to climb the tree. There were already many broken
              twigs lying on the shore, which were perfectly suitable for
              knitting. They first gathered them into a big pile, then selected
              the best ones and got to work.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              The frog started tinkering.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              He managed the work of his assistants, and himself performed the
              most difficult tasks. He made a strong ring from the thickest
              twig. Then he seemed to tie others to it, skillfully interweaving
              them. The work progressed, although not quickly, but unceasingly.
              The turtle and the crucian picked the right twigs and gave them to
              the frog.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              The green-eyed skillfully worked with the material with his thin
              fingers. He worked so hard that he didn't notice the time. After
              all, the work was moving, so it was already possible to tie the
              finished structure to a birch branch. Everything looked solid and
              corresponded to the original idea.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              The last stage remained - to add cattail feathers. Fortunately,
              there was plenty of it. Almost an island grew right next to it,
              which made it possible to quickly pick up the necessary material.
              The animals collected leaves and began to thread them between the
              willow branches. So a beautiful green basket was formed from
              almost a sieve.
            </p>
            <img

            />
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              The little engineers were very pleased. Everything turned out the
              way it was supposed to. And crafting together turned out to be
              interesting. They laughed and joked a lot without feeling tired.
              But such a case was still ahead.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              And the matter was really waiting. The silver moon majestically
              rolled out in the middle of the sky, and the stars scattered
              nearby twinkled, singing melodiously. The quiet surface of the
              water, like a magic mirror, reflected a shiny disk, to which a
              small spray path led.

                >- I swim best underwater. I think I should swim first</span
              >, - said the crucian.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              His friends looked at each other, but there was nothing to say in
              response. And indeed the fish swam in the water faster and more
              skillfully than anyone else.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica">- Yes</span>, -
              replied the turtle, and at that moment the frog nodded his head
              approvingly, -
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >take our ladle and grab this reflection. As you scoop, hold
                firmly in your hands. And we will swim up after you to look at
                our prey even for a moment.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              There was nothing to wait anymore and the friends got to work.
              Crucian grabbed the made bucket and deftly dived under the water.
              His friends followed him. It seemed that it would be possible to
              look at that silver glow. Look at its beauty and maybe even
              unravel the magic that beckons to you, riveting dreamy looks.
            </p>

            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              With decisive movements, the fish swam to the middle of the lake,
              holding the structure above itself. Boldly scooping up water, the
              crucian surfaced and quickly lowered its fins until the water had
              time to seep through the small cracks. Their diligent work paid
              off, and the water was really kept in the hemisphere of green
              interweaving for a long time. However, disappointment came so fast
              that the animals did not even notice the success of the
              constructed structure. After all, there was nothing in the water.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              The frog looked into the bucket with great interest.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- I don't see anything</span
              >, - he stated.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              And the crucian couldn't even utter a single word.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              The turtle was the last to swim up. At first she didn't even
              notice the sad fish eyes. She quickly looked into the water and
              didn't see anything either. Crucian silently handed the bucket to
              the frog and, barely holding back his tears, said:
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- It's all in vain</span
              >, - he turned sharply and swam in the direction of his house.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              The turtle and the frog were left alone.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- I will not give up</span
              >, - said the frog resolutely.
            </p>
            <img

              They looked around. The moon was still shining overhead and seemed
              to be mocking the little one below. And the reflection on the
              water treacherously moved further from the center of the lake. The
              frog grabbed the long handle of the ladle and swam towards him.
              The turtle faithfully followed him.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              And the second attempt ended without results! There was nothing in
              the scooped water, not even a small piece of that dreamy moon. The
              third attempt is empty again!
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- I don't have the strength anymore</span
              >, - said the turtle, breathing heavily, -
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >I'm terribly tired and I can't help you anymore, sorry.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              She turned to swim quietly home and finally said:
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- If you succees, I will be terribly happy for you. Look at the
                moon properly</span
              >, - she smiled, waved her paw and swam to her home, leaving the
              frog alone.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              In the morning, a sleepless crucian and a turtle woke up. They
              were disappointed by the lack of catch. But they wanted to know
              what happened to the frog. Maybe after all he managed to catch the
              glare and unravel the charms of the moon. Curiosity quickly took
              over and they almost simultaneously swam to the place where they
              had left the frog alone at night. But this time they found no one.
              They looked at each other in silence and decided to go to the
              frog's house.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              They knocked on his door and the sleepy frog opened it within a
              few minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- Frog, did you manage to catch the reflection?</span
              >
              - immediately blurted out the crucian.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              The frog showed both fatigue and a great desire to sleep. He said:
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica">- Yes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              Friends were extremely impressed.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica">- How?!</span> -
              the turtle and the crucian almost shouted at the same time.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- Friends, I really want to sleep. And it is better to show you
                than to explain. Let's go today, when the silver moon rises in
                the sky, I will show you everything.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">They agreed.</p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              This day was extremely long for the crucian and the turtle. They
              kept looking at the sky, but time seemed to stop on purpose. Even
              mundane matters did not distract from such news.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              And then the late evening came. A crucian and a turtle were
              already swimming in the middle of the lake. The frog was the last
              to come with the bucket.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- Well, tell and show already</span
              >, - said the turtle, -
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >I want to see that beautiful glow so much.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              The frog calmly smiled and began to speak:
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- Last night I could not understand what I was doing wrong for
                a long time. I tried again and again to swim up and catch the
                reflection. But every time I failed. In the end, my efforts led
                me to the far end of our lake. That's where the big rocks
                are.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              The turtle could not resist and interrupted the frog:
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- So you got out on a rock? And already got the glare of the
                moon?</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- And yes, and no</span
              >, - laughed the frog, -
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >Let's swim there and I'll show you everything.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              All together they went to the distant rocks. It took a long time
              to swim there - the lake was huge. However, persistence seemed to
              push them on. And soon they were right next to them.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- Crucian, you will have to stay here. You can't go on big
                stones. But I promise, we will show you everything together with
                the turtle</span
              >, - said the frog.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              So they did. The crucian remained in the water, and the frog and
              turtle climbed onto a large rock.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- Look turtle, I almost lost hope of success yesterday, but
                when I got here I couldn't even believe my eyes at first. Look,
                there is a small moon lying among those boulders.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- And indeed!</span
              >
              - she said in amazement.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              The frog took the made ladle and deftly scooped up a small silver
              reflection among the large stones in the water. He brought it
              closer and showed it to the turtle. And she couldn't utter a
              single word out of surprise.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- Go to the crucian! We need to show him too</span
              >, - said the frog.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              The friends quickly plunged into the water and brought the bucket
              to their friend. Crucian instantly looked inside and gasped in
              surprise:
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- How beautiful! But how?</span
              >
              - asked the crucian.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              Inside the green interweaving lay a small shiny stone, which in
              the bright moonbeams sparkled like magic. It reflected a beautiful
              silver glow that mesmerized everyone. And you could really see it
              up close.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >- You know, friends</span
              >, - said the frog, -
              <span class="section-catchTheGlare__text-replica"
                >It seems that I managed to catch a reflection. And that's
                enough for me.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              The green-eyed frog was very pleased. He looked at the sparkling
              pebble, its silver iridescence and incredible beauty of radiance.
              The crucian and the turtle couldn't take their eyes off either.
            </p>
            <p class="section-catchTheGlare__text">
              Together they joked and smiled. They thanked the frog for his
              perseverance and courage. But soon the sun began to peek out and
              the friends decided to put the stone where they took it. After
              all, who knows, maybe someone else will want to catch the glare.

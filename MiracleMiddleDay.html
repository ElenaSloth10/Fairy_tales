              There were flowers in grandmother's beautiful flower bed right
              next to the high fence. A variety of peonies, chrysanthemums,
              tulips along with colorful roses and many other beauties.
              Well-kept, in late spring they bloomed in all colors, shimmered
              with the colors of the most beautiful rainbow and smelled of the
              fragrant aroma of multifaceted perfumes.

            <p class="section-miracleMiddleDay__text">
              A swallow lived under the roof of the grandmother's house. She had
              already folded the nest and was busy with her own affairs. Only
              occasionally did she sit on the fence to exchange friendly words
              with flowers. And one day she noticed that the inhabitants of the
              flower bed became gloomy.

              >
              - asked the swallow.
            </p>
            <p class="section-miracleMiddleDay__text">
              <span class="section-miracleMiddleDay__text-replica"
                >- You will not understand us. You fly so high and so far that
                you can see a blue lake, a green forest, and even the tops of
                snowy mountains. And we only see this fence. There is nothing
                interesting with us</span
              >, - the peonies answered not cheerfully.
            </p>

              <span class="section-miracleMiddleDay__text-replica"

                near you. I encourage you. One day I will show a real shooting
                star.</span

              >, - the roses answered in surprise.
            </p>
            <p class="section-miracleMiddleDay__text">
              The swallow just smiled and flew on.
            </p>
            <p class="section-miracleMiddleDay__text">
              Only a few days have passed since that conversation and the
              swallow flew to the flower bed.
            </p>
            <p class="section-miracleMiddleDay__text">
              <span class="section-miracleMiddleDay__text-replica"

              >
              - said the bird,
              <span class="section-miracleMiddleDay__text-replica"
                >- So look at the sky!</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-miracleMiddleDay__text">
              The flowers were surprised and raised their buds to look at the
              blue sky.
            </p>
            <p class="section-miracleMiddleDay__text">
              At that moment, a light summer rain fell. The sun shone very
              brightly and illuminated every drop with a bright ray. The
              droplets seemed to turn into dazzling diamonds and sapphires. They
              overflowed and slowly fell. It felt like a real shooting star in
              the middle of the day.

              <span class="section-miracleMiddleDay__text-replica"

                closely.</span

            </p>
            <p class="section-miracleMiddleDay__text">
              The flowers smiled and thanked their friend.

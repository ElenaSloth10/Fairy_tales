            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              A little mouse lived in a magical world. She was distinguished by
              her purposeful character from a very young age. She coped with any
              difficulties, because she always brought the things she started to
              the end. For that, she was loved by those around her and praised
              by her family.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              And indeed, one could only envy the zeal of the little one. And
              the mouse dreamed on a huge scale. In her thoughts, she created
              beautiful things, helped animals, liked to literally create cities
              where all the citizens would live beautifully.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              But the great desire did not coincide with the small paws of the
              mouse. She looked at their tiny fingers and realized that she
              couldn't do it herself. A mighty force is needed. But where to get
              one? But who will tell?...
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              She thought of asking the one who was distinguished by the
              greatest wisdom. An advice of the snail is needed. The one in his
              sink should have known.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              A mouse ran out of her old hole. She looked around with a sad
              look, but smiled with hopeful eyes. Resolutely headed through the
              entire green ravine. The sun was already slowly beginning to slide
              towards the earth. Warm red rays passed between the leaves and
              blades of grass, enveloping the whole earth with their grace.
              Peace of mind.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              And here is the river. Fast, stormy and noisy, it looked majestic
              and playful at the same time. The mouse went down to the sandy
              shore. It's nice to live near big water. The rays reflect hundreds
              of multi-colored beads, generously scattered on the rushing water.
              Difficult to take the eyes off.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              And here, a little further downstream, there is a small sloping
              house of a snail.
            </p>

              - spoke the mouse.
            </p>

              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"

            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"

                definitely know.</span

            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              A slow snail hummed. A slight smile crossed the old age wrinkles.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"

                ability to create beautiful things? So that my dreams do not
                remain just an empty hope</span

            </p>

              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"
                >- Do you want to get magical skills?</span
              >
              - the old man looked at his guest, -
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"
                >To get them, you have to work hard, show courage, wisdom. And
                the main thing is not to forget about responsibility.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"
                >- Not every animal can boast of my zeal. I will not back down
                from my aim</span
              >, - she said loudly.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"
                >- Fine. Persuaded. I will tell you, so you could do good
                deeds.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              The snail turned around in its shell, stretched out its arms and
              calmly began to tell a story.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"
                >- Our world is full of magic. It is not so difficult to get
                them if you know how. And there is no need to regret spending
                charms on good deeds. Well, if you are not afraid, you should
                drink water from a high well.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"
                >- And that's all? Just tell me where to find it?</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"
                >- Everything and not everything. When you look into the well,
                there should be a silver moon floating there. With a thin slice,
                it should reflect off the water, and next to it are three bright
                stars. A flower that barely emerges from under the water should
                bloom in the white rays. It is in the core that you need to
                collect a magic drop with a ladle and drink it. Look for a well
                on the highest mountain. However, you are lively, there will be
                no trouble.</span
              >
            </p>
            <img

            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"
                >- I realized. It remains to get that ladle.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"
                >- So. The last time I heard that it was taken by the stork to
                its nest. You will recognize him immediately.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              The mouse quickly shook its head. She thanked the snail and ran
              with all her might. Everything became clear. A clear plan, step by
              step, was already clearly in front of her eyes. All that remains
              is to turn the idea into reality.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              It is already evening. The sun was hiding behind the edge of the
              sky, which told everyone else to sleep. The evening coolness, full
              of fragrant herbs, began to be felt. Multicolored flowers covered
              the buds, tired animals hid in their homes, the first stars began
              to sparkle high in the mountain. But mouse has her own task. There
              is no time to go to bed when such a big business is waiting for
              you.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              It was not difficult to find the stork's nest. At the very edge of
              a deep ravine stood an old oak tree. A long time ago, during a
              storm, it was struck by lightning, which broke the thick trunk. It
              was on it that the stork later built its wide nest. Many thick and
              thin branches were laid for strength. That's where you had to
              look.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              The mouse ran there with all her might. Her thin legs were wet
              from the evening dew, and steam was coming out of her mouth.
              Nothing could stop the determined animal.
            </p>
            <img
              class="section-withZeal__image-fourth"
              src="./images/tree-withZeal.svg"
              alt="tree-withZeal"
            />
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              And here is the old oak. She jumped on it and began to climb up.
              The shriveled bark was falling off in places, mouse had to jump
              between dry branches. But the skill of the animal was up to the
              crown. And she quickly got to the huge nest.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              She began to look and run in circles under the branches. In one
              moment, the long handle began to reflect the moonlight. There was
              no doubt, this was a magic ladle. Without thinking for a moment,
              the mouse grabbed it with all her might and begam to pull the
              magical object. It was not so easy to even move him from his
              place, as if he was stuck forever in that tangle. She tugged him
              this way and that until the twigs snapped and succumbed to her
              power. The ladle began to stretch out into the paws of the
              diligent mouse.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              Such an action could not fail to wake up the stork himself. He
              looked worried and saw the insolent. There was no doubt, the big
              bird will protect his good. He jumped up and began to peck
              everything he saw in front of him with all his might. He bit the
              little paw so hard that she screamed at the top of her voice.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              The mouse got scared and started to climb down and run as far as
              possible. Her wound hurt, she pressed her crippled paw to herself.
              However, the work was done and the ladle was extracted.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              The angry stork flew up, spread its wide wings and clucked its
              beak menacingly. If it weren't for the tall grass, it would be
              bitter for the little mouse. She was already running and heard
              only from a distance how the nest moved to the side, the twigs
              cracked and it fell near the very roots of the once majestic oak
              tree.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              It was difficult to run on three legs and hold on to your catch.
              However, the mouse did not give up. Half the job was done. But
              there was such a luck - the moon hung like a thin slice in the
              middle of the clear sky. It is necessary to act urgently.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              She had to run for a long time, dragging the ladle behind her. But
              no matter how difficult it was to push through the thick grass,
              bypass the lakes and climb up, the mouse did not give up. Her goal
              was before her. It remains only to reach the very top of the
              mountain. And here she is.
            </p>
            <img
              class="section-withZeal__image-fifth"

              alt="well-withZeal"
            />
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              The old slanting well barely peeked out above the ground. The
              animal climbed onto its edge and looked around. It was as if the
              world had stopped. Such harmony unfolded in front of the eyes,
              which captured the spirit. One could feel the triumph of the
              little mouse's courage. The entire ravine and not only seemed to
              be lying at her feet. A silver mist wrapped around the foot of the
              mountain, lifting the winner to a well-deserved pedestal. And the
              silence of the night echoed the parade march in the ears with
              thousands of drums. Such moments do not happen often in a
              lifetime.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              The moon, framed by three bright stars, was visible in a beautiful
              thin arc in the calm water. And in the middle, a beautiful flower
              bloomed with white petals. There were no doubts, all the snail's
              words came true. With one paw, although it was difficult, the
              mouse lowered the magic ladle and drew water from the very core.
              She took out and drank one drop of magic water.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              The witchcraft worked immediately. The mouse felt a surge of
              incredible strength. It was as if bubbles had formed on her hands,
              emitting a silver glow. They pulsed through the muscles, reaching
              the very tips of the paws. The little mouse was so happy with her
              new strength that she didn't even notice how she dropped the
              ladle.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              It was beginning to dawn. Asterisks barely twinkled from one end.
              The moon was dissolving in the bright sky. The first rays of
              sunlight began to break through the darkness. The silence was
              broken by chirping birds, filling the entire ravine with life. The
              animals were waking up, rejoicing at the new warm day and
              returning to their daily activities. The tired mouse limped home.
              She really wanted to sleep, but new sensations and emotions
              prevented her from falling asleep. Such an event, as if the little
              mouse life turned upside down. It was necessary to undertake the
              realization of dreams, no matter how alarming it was to start such
              a business.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              And the task was not simple - to build a whole city. The old huts,
              although they served their owners faithfully, were already bent
              from old age. Small animals did not deserve such a home. The mouse
              began to cast a spell. She waved her healthy hand in front of her
              and images of houses began to appear in the air. Boards, windows,
              multi-colored doors began to be assembled brick by brick. It was
              as if order was forming in the whirlwind. And there were already
              several beautiful houses.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              But not even a minute passed when they tilted, rattled and went to
              the side. Terror gripped the once clear eyes of the animal. No
              magic happened, no houses are built, no beautiful city is created.
              No matter how much the mouse casts spells, the foundation of the
              building does not come out of it, there is no solid foundation.
              And because of that, the walls tilt, and the whole structure
              leans.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              How bitter it became in the soul. The eyes filled with heavy tears
              that rolled down the cheeks. All in vain. Such a work was done to
              get magical powers and everything for nothing. What is power when
              the dream itself was not destined to come true? The world around
              darkened, the colors faded, the empty eyes of the animals around
              pierced the very heart.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              The mouse looked at her paws and a cold thought came to her. It is
              possible to cast spells at half strength, since only one leg is
              intact. The sick one will not be able to create like that. But
              what to do, she is to blame. She could not get the ladle without
              hurting herself. Despondent, broken and disappointed, she went
              home. Crawled into the burrow. Annoyance and mental pain prevented
              her from falling asleep at first. Then fatigue took over and the
              animal fell into a long sleep.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              The mouse woke up the next morning. It was still a beautiful start
              to the day. The ravine was green with lush flowers, the scent of
              flowers filled the air, the river splashed against the pebbles.
              The world has not changed since yesterday, but it has turned
              upside down for one soul.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              The mouse came out of its hole. The wound had clearly begun to
              heal, strength returned to the muscles, strength was felt in the
              paw. Hope rose. She immediately ran out into the street and began
              to cast spells with both hands. With new strength, new houses
              appeared, even more beautiful than before. However, as soon as
              they were assembled, the buildings sagged and collapsed. They had
              no strength. The hope did not come true. The mouse was angry
              because she could not finish her task. She stopped casting spells
              and ran with all her might to the old snail.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"
                >- You deceived me!</span
              >
              - she shouted from afar.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              The sleepy snail woke up from such shouts, even without immediate
              understanding who was in front of him.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"
                >- I did everything as you said, but nothing worked</span
              >, - the mouse sat down next to the old man and cried.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              The snail didn't need the explanation about what exactly happened.
              He heard of other animals and about the stork's nest on the old
              oak tree, and about the return of the mouse, and about the ruined
              houses.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"
                >- Do not cry. Tears definitely won't help here. I've heard of
                your magic and of crumbling houses. After all, they have no
                foundation. And I know why you can't make a solid
                foundation</span
              >, - smiled the old man.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica">- Why?</span> - she
              asked tearfully.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"
                >- In order to obtain magical powers, it was necessary to show
                courage, perseverance and wisdom.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"
                >- I did everything like that. I took out a ladle, got to the
                well and drank the magic water</span
              >, - lamented the mouse.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"
                >- So. But it was necessary to show wisdom and responsibly go
                the whole way. When you took out the magic ladle, you broke the
                stork's nest. This is his home. Its destruction is on your
                conscience. That ladle is useless to him, and if you had asked
                politely, he would have given it to you anyway. Then your foot
                would be whole and the magic would be fully working.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              The mouse was surprised by such words. It never occurred to her to
              do so. What to do, but it must be admitted - she did wrong. She
              did not show wisdom. she herself is to blame for her misfortune.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              She wiped her tears, stood up, thanked the old snail. And then she
              said:
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"
                >- Now I know what to do. I need to correct your mistake, even
                if the charms will not work at full strength.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              The mouse quickly ran to the very edge of the green ravine. The
              old oak seemed not so big and formidable in the sunlight.
              Scattered branches lay near the roots of the tree, the remains of
              what was once a bird's nest. The animal felt sad. It was her
              actions that led to the downfall. And that was not what she wanted
              when she boldly dreamed in her little hole.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              The stork sat at the very top of the tree and sadly bowed its head
              down. Mouse called him at the top of her voice, although it was
              scary. He went downstairs and gave a stern look at the little
              thief who had the audacity to return. Before he could say a word,
              the mouse said loudly:
            </p>

            />
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"
                >- Forgive me, please! I have caused you great harm. And i did
                the wrong thing when decided to take the magic ladle. I wanted
                so much to cast a spell and did not understand that it was
                impossible to act like that. If you allow me, I will try to
                correct my fault</span
              >, - said the mouse calmly.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              It was clear that the stork was very angry at the little insolent.
              However, he did not argue:
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"
                >- Correct your dishonorable act. And promise that you will
                never do such an irresponsible thing again!</span
              >
              - said the stork menacingly, -
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica"
                >only for the fact that you admit your guilt and promise to look
                for your fault first in any disagreement, I forgive you.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              <span class="section-withZeal__text-replica">- I promise!</span> -
              said the mouse, bowing her head.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              Then she raised her paws uphill and felt a completely new
              strength, as if she had not been able to cast spells in full force
              before. All the small twigs rose up and began to fold and
              intertwine into a wide nest at the very top of the old oak tree.
              So, one by one, they created a complete home for their owner. The
              stork rose, looked at his new home and nodded his head
              approvingly.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              The little one's joy knew no bounds. Here it is. For the first
              time, she truly fulfilled her dream. She embodied a good deed that
              required courage and responsibility. Now it was possible to
              completely create other ideas.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              As fast as she returned home mouse began to cast spells. This time
              the foundation was already very strong. Mouse did not just create
              new houses and streets, which were intertwined into a beautiful
              and cozy city. She asked each little animal about its wishes and
              created an appropriate home. So, one house after another, that
              dream city was formed.
            </p>
            <p class="section-withZeal__text">
              Flat houses with beautiful roofs meandered into green streets.
              They intertwined and resembled a tangled web. Even the old snail
              wanted to move and settle next to the little mouse. So in the
              evenings, they still have thoughtful conversations.

              The old winding road, which on both sides had long been overgrown
              with ancient trees, led the two best friends. They were little
              otter cubs called Kaminchyk and Prominchyk. The friendly morning
              sun made its way through the thick leaves, illuminated the dew
              drops on the green leaves of the April grass like scattered
              diamonds. Dawn predicted the beginning of a new day, as if the
              beginning of a new life. It was so nice to look at the little
              animals, who were happy with the first rays of light and
              cheerfully had a friendly conversation.
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              The path led them to a beautiful city where Kaminchyk once
              visited. He often mentioned this small, town of ordinary animals,
              who daily engaged in ordinary affairs, building and improving
              houses and streets. The alleys meandered in an elegant ribbon,
              emphasizing the slenderness of the buildings. Long vines of ivy
              and grapes diluted this symmetry with bright spots. Instead, parks
              and squares were characterized by balanced forms and evenly
              trimmed plants. All this was often surrounded by the intoxicating
              aroma of morning coffee or freshly baked pies with cherries,
              apples, and currants. With these memories, it was as if they were
              wrapped in a warm shawl tied by their grandmother and given a cup
              of hot cocoa in their hands after a walk with bare feet in the
              morning dew.
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              However, approaching the city, the animals could not believe their
              eyes. The once bright and welcoming city was hard to recognize.
            </p>
            <img
              class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__image-second"
              src="./images/town-kaminchykProminchyk.svg"
              alt="town-kaminchykProminchyk"
            />
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              The sun's rays were blocked by heavy lead clouds. A thick fog
              enveloped the streets, like smoke from a raging fire. And it was
              like a huge soap bubble, which tightly covered all areas like a
              metal sarcophagus, that prevented him from dissipating. Now it was
              difficult to see well thought-out parks, developed avenues and
              green squares. The aroma of coffee shops and bakeries faded, the
              bright signs of small shops faded, the city fountain splashed
              joylessly. Stubborn Kaminchyk still wanted to see the once bright
              colors, but even there were no words to describe such a striking
              change.
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              Then the purposeful Prominchyk decided to find out what happened.
              He confidently headed down the winding sidewalk straight to the
              central square. There it was not difficult to find preoccupied
              animals, gloomily immersed in everyday affairs. They quickly
              approached the sullen badger who was selling newspapers.
            </p>

            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              <span class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text-replica"
                >- Good morning!</span
              >
              - Prominchyk took the floor.
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              In response, the old badger nodded his head and continued to
              unfold whole stacks of black and white paper. Baby otter continued
              the conversation. This time Kaminchyk said:
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              <span class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text-replica"
                >- Good sir. I have been to your city and I remember it
                completely different. Won't you tell me what happened? What
                happened to its inhabitants?</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              The seller, not at all surprised by such a question, began his
              story with difficulty and tiredness:
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              <span class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text-replica"
                >- The city was like an ordinary city. And then one day a
                terrible wind arose, everything hummed and the animals were
                frightened. A huge and scary black bird flew right behind the
                roar. With his strong claws, he began to tear the roofs of
                houses. He broke windows and felled trees with his beak. We have
                never seen such burning anger in the eyes of a bird. And
                everything is so instantaneous. As if someone pierced the
                painting of a talented artist with an arrow and a big hole
                remained in the middle of the bright picture.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              Baby otters were amazed by such a story. But after looking at each
              other, Kaminchyk belligerently asked:
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              <span class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text-replica"
                >- So where is he now? Must overcome immediately!</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              <span class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text-replica"
                >- It's too late to chase him. Very quickly, the feathered
                turned into black clots and fell to the ground. They firmly
                stuck to the backs of heads of the animals as sinewy octopuses,
                sucking all the sparks from their eyes. No one could do
                anything, we live with such a scourge.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              The friends looked around and looked closely at the passers-by.
              And indeed, each of them wore an octopus on the back of their
              head, which grabbed tightly and clutched their heads. It was a
              pity for the residents and the once flourishing city. But what to
              do?
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              They thanked the seller and went to the nearest bench. It was
              necessary to think over such a frightening story. Baby otters sat
              and consulted, they really wanted to return the smiles, dispel the
              lingering fog and let the spring rays reach the streets of the
              city.
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              <span class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text-replica"
                >- We need to return the colors</span
              >, - said Prominchyk.
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              <span class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text-replica"
                >- This is not enough</span
              >, - answered Kaminchyk.
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              <span class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text-replica"
                >- So. Large-scale and decisive actions are needed here. We will
                create our own sorcery. Let's go, I have an idea!</span
              >
            </p>

            />
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              Prominchyk resolutely got up and, full of his enthusiasm, headed
              across the entire square. Kaminchik immediately went after him.
              While wandering the streets for a short time, they came across a
              small stationery store. They bought all the colorful chalk in it
              and put it in their backpack.
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              The plan of action has already been adopted, all that remains is
              to implement the idea into life. They headed to the largest square
              of the ancient city. Got new purchases and started painting their
              birds. Passers-by looked around in surprise and
              incomprehensibility, did not understand the intentions of the
              travelers, but did not interfere with them.
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              Kaminchyk and Beaminchik mixed and alternated colors. They boldly
              experimented with shapes, sizes and colors. The birds came out
              sometimes big, sometimes small. They resembled already familiar
              species of birds - pigeons, titmice or storks, then they looked
              like fantastic fictional animals that only had wings and a beak.
              Some had a majestic appearance, others funny. Baby otters boldly
              fantasized and showed creativity. They painted as they could. And
              very soon, almost the entire asphalt was bursting with bright
              colors. Then the friends blew with persistent faith and lifted all
              the birds into the sky. It looked like a real miracle. The spirit
              was taken away from such an action.
            </p>
            <img

            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              Colorful wings flew along avenues and alleys. Magical creatures
              began to carefully and safely envelop the townspeople, and peck
              black octopuses with their strong beaks. Until they fell off and
              crumbled into ashes.
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              The little otters had to draw and cast spells for a long time. And
              the multi-colored wings work to return all the sparks to the eyes.
              Little by little, the smiles began to return, and the fog began to
              dissipate. The friends noticed that their idea was working and
              even more diligently drew beautiful lines with colorful chalk,
              forming living creatures.
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              The animals seemed to wake up. Warm rays of the sun passed through
              the remnants of the fog and reflected from the smiling eyes of the
              townspeople. As if the holiday has come. They began to rebuild
              houses and create new, even better and better ones. Later, the
              soap bubble burst.
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              At that point, baby otters looked around. They did a good job.
              It's good for the soul. It is already evening. For the first time
              in a long time stars could be seen. So bright, scattered by a
              careless hand, they only emphasized the greatness of the moon.
              Quiet and peaceful all around. But it is known for sure - tomorrow
              will be the next pleasant day and the sun will rise over the
              glorious city.
            </p>
            <p class="section-kaminchykProminchyk__text">
              Now Kaminchyk was able to experience the same memories and give
              the same impressions to Prominchyk. This became the best reward.
